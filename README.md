# Problem-Solving-using-K-Means-Clustering-algorithm
* A Hospital Care chain wants to open a series of Emergency-Care wards within a region. We assume that the hospital knows the location of all the maximum accident-prone areas in the region. They have to decide the number of the Emergency Units to be opened and the location of these Emergency Units, so that all the accident-prone areas are covered in the vicinity of these Emergency Units. 
* We can provide an automated solution to this problem using K-Means Clustering algorithm which can be fed with a dataset containing the geographic statistics and other details of the accident prone areas within the targeted region.
# Implementation
* In this project, a dataset having the information about accidents happened in America in December 2021, has been used to solve the above stated problem using a Machine Learnign Algorithm i.e K-Means Clustering in this case.
* We initiate with the K-means Clustering grouping these locations of maximum prone areas into clusters and define a cluster center for each cluster, which will be the locations where the Emergency Units will open. 
* These cluster centers are the centroids of each cluster and are at a minimum distance from all the points of a particular cluster, hence, the Emergency Units will be at minimum distance from all the accident prone areas within a cluster, which satisfies the objective.
# Testing
* The number of clusters changes could be made and tested with different number of clusters each time according to the data available and the problem to be solved.
